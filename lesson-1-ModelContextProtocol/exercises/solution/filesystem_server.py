"""
Simple file system MCP server implemented with the `mcp` library.

This server exposes a few safe file operations as MCP tools.  The
`write_file`, `append_to_file`, and `read_file` tools operate within a
specified base directory (by default the current working directory).  To
protect the host system, all file paths are resolved relative to the base
directory and validated to ensure they stay within it.  If you need to
restrict the server further, pass a path on the command line when starting
the server to limit access.
