    "2. **Thread Isolation**\n",
    "   - If two users interact with the same workflow at the same time, how does the system ensure that their conversations remain separate?\n",

    "## Coding Exercise: Implementing Persistent Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "This hands-on exercise lets you apply what you've learned. You'll extend the LangGraph application below to incorporate memory and personalize responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario:** You are building a simple dining assistant that remembers each user's dietary preferences and personalizes its responses.\n",
    ".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks to Complete\n",
    "\n",
    "Modify the application below by implementing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Add Memory Persistence**\n",
    "   - Import `InMemorySaver` from `langgraph.checkpoint.memory`\n",
    "   - Modify the workflow to compile with this checkpointer\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Track User Preferences**\n",
    "    - Use `InMemorySaver` for state persistence so that the assistant remembers preferences across separate invocations.\n",
    "    - Pass a unique thread ID in the `config` to ensure conversation isolation for each user.\n",
    "    - Extend the application state with a `user_memory` dictionary to store dietary preferences (e.g. vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free) and a visit counter.\n",
    "    - Implement the `remember_preferences` function that detects preferences from incoming messages, updates the stored preferences and visit count, and appends personalized suggestions and welcome-back messages.\n",
    "    - Connect the `remember_preferences` node to the appropriate edges in the workflow.\n",
    "    - Compile the workflow with a checkpointer and test it by invoking it multiple times with the same thread ID to verify persistence.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Test Persistence**\n",
    "   - Invoke the workflow twice using the same `thread_id`\n",
    "   - Observe how the second invocation uses the stored preference\n"
